# GeoDataProcessing

GeoDataProcessing is a software designed to process data extracted from a pressuremeter test.   
It is yet to be finished, but it already supports basic data process as well as some configurable options.


### Installation

Download the folder "GeoDataProcessing".


### Usage

You can put the shortcut in your desktop folder or simply double-click on the .exe application.  
An in-app help menu will soon be implemented.


### Support

Again, an in-app support menu will soon be implemented but for the moment you can just email me to paul.wassermannn@gmail.com
